Intro to C# Assessment, made using Visual Studio

Welcome to my assessment, I hope you like it!

To build the project from Visual Studio, which the project from the debug configuration to the release configuration, and then click Build Solution from the Build dropdown menu

After building, the project should be a playable .exe application, which is in the Release folder within thebin folder of the original project

The game is a text-based, Oregon Trail eqsue adventure. The game is controlled exclusively with the keyboard, by typing what you want to do based on prompts

After you are past the opening and/or tutorial, you can check your options for what to type at any time by typing 'commands' or 'command list'
